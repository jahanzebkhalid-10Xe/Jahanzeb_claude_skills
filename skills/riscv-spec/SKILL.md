name: riscv-spec
description: Answer any RISC-V question from the authoritative sources — the ratified specifications at docs.riscv.org (ISA manual, SBI, psABI, debug, trace, IOMMU, AIA, PLIC, platform, ACPI) and the RISC-V Unified Database (UDB) for machine-readable instruction encodings, CSR field layouts, extension versions, profiles and parameters. Use this skill whenever the user asks about a RISC-V instruction, encoding, CSR, extension, profile, ISA string, SBI call, calling convention, or debug/trace interface; whenever the user says "UDB", "the spec", "is this ratified", or "is this compliant"; and whenever RISC-V development, testing, bring-up, code review or debugging needs a specification reference — even if the user names no source.

# riscv-spec — answer RISC-V questions from the authoritative sources

## The three layers

RISC-V has no single file that answers every question. It has three sources, and
each one is authoritative for something different. Using the wrong one produces a
confident wrong answer, so route the question before you answer it.

1. **Ratified prose — docs.riscv.org.** The "RISC-V Ratified Specifications
   Library", published by RISC-V International. Everything in it is ratified
   today, though it carries an empty "Specifications Under Development" section,
   so confirm status rather than inferring it from the site alone.
   Authoritative for meaning, rules, and compliance.
2. **Machine-readable ISA data — UDB.** A local clone of `riscv-unified-db`.
   Authoritative for instruction encodings, CSR bit layouts, field types, and
   parameters, because those are validated against riscv-opcodes and LLVM.
3. **Non-ISA specifications — docs.riscv.org only.** SBI, psABI, debug, trace,
   IOMMU, AIA, PLIC, platform, ACPI. UDB does not model these at all.

Everything else — Spike, QEMU, GCC, LLVM, RTL, the user's code — is never a
source of truth. When one of them disagrees with layers 1 and 2, the tool is the
suspect. Report the mismatch as a finding.

## Precedence when sources disagree

Work down this ladder and stop at the first source that answers the question:

1. `docs.riscv.org` at a pinned version URL — published ratified text.
2. `https://riscv.org/specifications/ratified/` — the authoritative ratified index.
3. The Ratified Extensions wiki — ratified but not yet published in any spec.
4. The ISA manual preface status table — per-extension `Ratified`/`Frozen`/`Draft`.
5. UDB YAML — bit-level encodings, CSR layouts, parameters.
6. Tools, hardware, and user code — evidence about an implementation, never truth.

One exception runs the other way. For an encoding or a CSR bit position, prefer
UDB even over the prose, because prose tables lose fidelity when converted to
text, while UDB's encodings carry third-party validation.

## Step 1 — Locate the sources

**The ratified specs** are cached by this skill's own script. No clone needed.

```bash
python3 <skill>/scripts/riscv_docs.py list      # what exists, and what is cached
python3 <skill>/scripts/riscv_docs.py status    # cache contents and fetch dates
```

**UDB** is a local git clone. Find it in this order, and call the result `$UDB`:

1. The `UDB_ROOT` environment variable.
2. `~/riscv-unified-db`, then `~/projects/riscv-unified-db`.
3. `find ~/projects ~/work ~/src ~/dev -maxdepth 3 -type d -name riscv-unified-db 2>/dev/null | head -3`
4. No hit: tell the user, and offer to clone it (~500 MB, ask first):
   `git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-unified-db.git ~/riscv-unified-db`

Confirm a real clone with `test -f "$UDB/spec/std/isa/ext/I.yaml"`.

UDB questions are answerable without the ratified cache, and ratified-spec
questions are answerable without UDB. Never block one on the other.

## Step 2 — Refresh, once per day

Specifications change. Stale data is the main way this skill can be wrong.

```bash
python3 <skill>/scripts/riscv_docs.py versions          # cheap: ~400 bytes per spec
python3 <skill>/scripts/riscv_docs.py fetch sbi --all   # only when it reports STALE
```

The version check is cheap because each spec publishes a small redirect stub that
names its current version. Re-fetch only what changed.

For UDB, read the data date with `git -C "$UDB" log -1 --format=%cd --date=short`.
If it is more than a day old, and `UDB_NO_PULL` is unset, run `git -C "$UDB" fetch
origin`, then `git -C "$UDB" pull --ff-only` only when the tree is clean, the
branch is `main`, and the branch is behind. If the tree is dirty or the branch
diverged, do not pull. Report the state and continue with current data.

## Step 3 — Route the question

| Question is about | Go to |
|---|---|
| Instruction encoding, opcode, bit fields | UDB `inst/` YAML |
| Instruction behavior | UDB `operation()` IDL, then the ISA manual for intent |
| CSR address, field location, WARL, reset | UDB `csr/` YAML |
| Whether an extension is ratified | ratified index, then Ratified Extensions wiki, then preface table |
| Extension dependencies, versions | UDB `ext/` YAML |
| Profile membership (RVA23 and similar) | UDB resolved profile, then the profile doc |
| SBI, psABI, debug, trace, IOMMU, AIA, PLIC, ACPI, platform | the ratified cache only |
| Normative wording, compliance, "is this legal" | the ratified cache |

Search the ratified cache with a regex; it prints a citable URL for every hit:

```bash
python3 <skill>/scripts/riscv_docs.py search 'hart_mask_base' --slug sbi
```

For UDB queries, read [references/udb-queries.md](references/udb-queries.md).
Before interpreting a UDB file type for the first time, read
[references/udb-data-model.md](references/udb-data-model.md). For the ratified
site's URL scheme and its traps, read
[references/live-sources.md](references/live-sources.md). For installation and
optional power-ups, read [references/setup.md](references/setup.md).

## Answer contract

Every answer must let the user verify it without trusting you:

1. **Cite precisely.** For the ratified specs, give the versioned URL with the
   section anchor, such as
   `https://docs.riscv.org/reference/sbi/v3.0/binary-encoding.html#3-1-1-hart-list-parameter`.
   For UDB, give the file path.
2. **Quote verbatim.** Copy `encoding.match`, bit locations, `operation()`, and
   normative sentences exactly. Never retype or tidy them. A one-bit typo inverts
   the meaning.
3. **Name the version.** Give the spec version for ratified text, and the UDB
   commit date for UDB data.
4. **State the status.** Say whether an extension is ratified, frozen, or draft.
   Flag anything that is not ratified, and flag `spec/custom/` as vendor-specific.
5. **Say when sources disagree.** Show both, name which one is ratified, and say
   which you followed.

## Traps that produce wrong answers

Each of these has bitten a real lookup. Check them before answering.

- **A nightly is not a release.** `riscv-isa-manual` tags a release per commit,
  named `riscv-isa-release-<sha>-<date>`. UDB's `ext/riscv-isa-manual` submodule
  pins one of those nightlies, so it mixes ratified, frozen, and draft chapters.
  Read the preface status table before you call anything ratified.
- **Newest is not ratified.** docs.riscv.org may publish an older ISA manual
  version than the newest nightly, precisely because it publishes only ratified
  milestones.
- **Never cite an unversioned URL.** `/reference/<slug>/index.html` is a redirect
  stub that floats to the latest version. Cite `/reference/<slug>/<version>/...`.
- **Never fetch `/reference/search-index.js`.** It is a 28 MB client-side index
  and it will stall. Use the script's `search` over the local cache instead.
- **Never read an encoding out of a PDF.** Table extraction mangles bit fields.
  Use UDB YAML.
- **Archived and missing repositories.** `riscv/riscv-profiles` is archived and
  its content moved into the ISA manual. `riscv-non-isa/riscv-platform-specs`
  does not exist. `riscof` is archived and its documentation is stale from 2022.
  Most per-repository `github.io` sites now return 404; psABI is the exception.
- **UDB's published site carries no disclaimer.** The "UNOFFICIAL" label appears
  only in the repository README, so supply that caveat yourself.
- **RISC-V's status vocabulary is inconsistent** across its own pages, which list
  four, six, and eight states. Use one mapping: `Ratified`, `Frozen`, `Draft`.
  UDB's lowercase `development` maps to `Draft`.

## When the network is unavailable

Degrade, and say so. Answer from the local cache and from UDB, then add one line
naming the cache date and warning that a newer version may exist. Do not refuse
to answer, and do not silently present stale data as current.

## Scope limits

These sources cover the architecture and its platform interfaces. They do not
cover vendor errata, board bring-up details, or toolchain bugs. When a question
falls outside, say so plainly and name a better source rather than guessing.
